`rerddap` is a general purpose R client for working with ERDDAP servers.

## Installation

From CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rerddap")
```

Or development version from GitHub

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rerddap")
```

```{r}
library("rerddap")
```

Some users may experience an installation error, stating to install 1 or more 
packages, e.g., you may need `DBI`, in which case do, for example, 
`install.packages("DBI")` before installing `rerddap`.

## Background

ERDDAP is a server built on top of OPenDAP, which serves some NOAA data. You can get gridded data ([griddap](https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/documentation.html)), which lets you query from gridded datasets, or table data ([tabledap](https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/documentation.html)) which lets you query from tabular datasets. In terms of how we interface with them, there are similarities, but some differences too. We try to make a similar interface to both data types in `rerddap`.

## NetCDF

`rerddap` supports NetCDF format, and is the default when using the `griddap()` function. NetCDF is a binary file format, and will have a much smaller footprint on your disk than csv. The binary file format means it's harder to inspect, but the `ncdf4` package makes it easy to pull data out and write data back into a NetCDF file. Note the the file extension for NetCDF files is `.nc`. Whether you choose NetCDF or csv for small files won't make much of a difference, but will with large files.

## Caching

Data files downloaded are cached in a single directory on your machine determined by the [hoardr][] package. When you use `griddap()` or `tabledap()` functions, we construct a MD5 hash from the base URL, and any query parameters - this way each query is separately cached. Once we have the hash, we look in the cache directory for a matching hash. If there's a match we use that file on disk - if no match, we make a http request for the data to the ERDDAP server you specify.

## ERDDAP servers

You can get a data.frame of ERDDAP servers using the function `servers()`. Most I think serve some kind of NOAA data, but there are a few that aren't NOAA data.  If you know of more ERDDAP servers, send a pull request, or let us know.

## Search

First, you likely want to search for data, specify either `griddadp` or `tabledap`

```{r ed_search_table}
ed_search(query = "size", which = "table")
```

```{r ed_search_grid}
ed_search(query = "size", which = "grid")
```

## Information

Then you can get information on a single dataset

```{r}
info("erdMBchla1day")
```

## griddap (gridded) data

```{r}
(out <- info("erdMBchla1day"))
```

```{r griddap_data}
(res <- griddap(out,
  time = c("2015-01-01", "2015-01-03"),
  latitude = c(14, 15),
  longitude = c(125, 126)
))
```

## tabledap (tabular) data

```{r tabledap_info, output.lines=1:15}
(out <- info("erdCinpKfmBT"))
```

```{r tabledap_data, output.lines=1:25}
tabledap("erdCinpKfmBT", "time>=2007-06-24", "time<=2007-07-01")
```
